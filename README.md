# Test task for Internship in Data Science

### Airbus Ship Detection Challenge

This notebook contains my solution Kaggle's [Airbus Ship Detection challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbus-ship-detection/code?competitionId=9988&sortBy=scoreDescending&language=Python). 


This task requires you to find ships in the images and place an aligned bounding box segment around the ships. 


The solution includes several files:

  Exploration and analysis 

	Data_analysis.ipynb

  Config file 
  
	config.py


  Keras implementation of Unet architecture.

	unet.py

  Run prediction of trained model on first image from test_2 directory.

	inference.py

  Function library for decoing masks, generating images for training, etc.

	utils.py

  Run data preparation, augmentation and traing of model with training history graphs as output.

    training.py

  Package requirements for solution

	requirements.tx
